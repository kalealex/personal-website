				Hello! I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and the Data
				Science Institute at the University of Chicago, where I lead the <a href="dcl-website/index.html">Data Cognition Lab</a>. 
				I study data cognition and interaction: how people interpret, reason about, and act on data; and how the design of
				visualizations, software, and AI systems can support or undermine that process. My work
				combines tool-building with theory and evaluation methods from decision science, CS, statistics, and cognitive psychology.

				I completed my PhD and MS at the University of Washington (UW) Information School. During this time I collaborated with
				the <a href="https://mucollective.northwestern.edu/">Midwest Uncertainty Collective</a> at Northwestern University CS, 
				the <a href="http://idl.cs.washington.edu/">Interactive Data Lab</a> at UW CS&amp;E, and the <a href="https://github.com/interpretml/interpret">Interpret ML</a>
				team at Microsoft Research. Before that I earned my BS with honors in Psychology, and minors in Music and Philosophy, at UW in 2015.

				I create and evaluate software to help people think with data. Visualizations and software often mediate our interactions
				with data, in part because these media facilitate efficiency in thinking and communication. However, our current approaches
				to thinking with data often fail to account for the cognitive mechanisms that guide people's interpretations of data,
				such as heuristics and other dynamic processes of the mind which underly human judgment and decision making. As a result,
				tools for reasoning with data leave us open to the failure modes of human cognition, especially around applications involving
				uncertainty and statistical reasoning. My research aims to address these problems by creating tools that explicitly represent
				the user's cognitive process and by pursuing a more theoretically grounded and empirically rigorous science behind the design
				of software tools for data science and visualization.

			<p>I create and evaluate tools to help people think with data. Tools such as visualizations, statistical software, and AI systems 
				mediate our interactions with data by facilitating efficiency in thinking and communication. However, the efficiency and 
				authoritativeness of these tools presents certain threats: (1) that people will accept/ignore evidence or algorithmic advice 
				at face value, rather than rigorously understanding it; (2) that data interfaces may be nominally informative without being 
				sufficiently personalized to be useful for specific user groups and tasks; and (3) that data and AI systems will disempower 
				human users through obfuscation and denial of agency. My research aims to address these problems by creating tools that
				account for natural cognitive pitfalls in data interpretation, by taking a participatory approach to software design, and by
				developing new theories and understandings of how we can make data interaction both more rigorous and more humanistic.

					<h3>Designing for Inference with Visualizations</h3>
					<p>University of Chicago 2025 - Committee on Quantitative Methods Fall Workshop<br />
						Visualizations mediate a large portion of human-data interactions, especially when we want to analyze or communicate about patterns of interest 
						in data. For example, software for exploratory data analysis and scientific figures alike are used to surface statistical signals intended to 
						drive interpretation and decision-making. The design ethos of these tools is that people will be able to infer meaning and significance from data 
						patterns if they are rendered visible. Is this a reasonable assumption about human cognition? And if it isn’t, can we design visualizations differently 
						to support the intended inferences? In this talk, I describe an arc of research&mdash;from experimental evaluation of human inference capabilities with visualization 
						to software prototyping of alternative design patterns for visuo-statistical inference&mdash;that aims to address these questions. First, I present a pair 
						of crowdsourced experiments attempting to measure the quality of structural causal inferences drawn from visualized data. Findings suggest that visualizations 
						of observed data on their own are less helpful for causal induction than visualization designers tend to assume. I discuss limitations of these studies and what 
						I think they reveal about human data cognition. Second, I present efforts to develop software that incorporates lessons about the fragility of inferences from 
						visualized data into exploratory data analysis workflows. I demonstrate how my team envisioned that more explicit checking of provisional statistical 
						interpretations could benefit interactive data discovery through visualization, and I share qualitative findings from a user study that inform on the efficacy 
						of our prototype. In closing, I discuss cognitive and technical challenges for the future of visualization and visual analytics software.

					<h3>Designing for Epistemic Uncertainty in Research Synthesis</h3>
					<p>University of Wisconsin at Madison 2023 - Seminar on Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis<br />
						Summarizing what can be learned from bodies of scientific literature requires difficult judgments about which study results can be meaningfully
						compared, and whether it makes sense to aggregate evidence in a meta-analysis. Numerous tools for assessing quality of evidence offer guidance
						on identifying sources of epistemic uncertainty, such as common threats to internal or external validity of study results. However, existing
						software for systematic review and meta-analysis does little to emphasize how epistemic uncertainty should inform analytic choices for synthesizing
						findings. I present MetaExplorer, a prototype web application designed to provide a guided process for reasoning about epistemic uncertainty in
						meta-analysis. I also summarize findings from interviews with research synthesis methodologists and practitioners in biomedical science, education,
						computer science, and statistics. This work highlights the cognitive pitfalls, technical hurdles, and inconsistent standards across research communities
						that pose challenges to addressing epistemic uncertainty in research synthesis. I reflect on opportunities for future software development and invite the
						audience to join me in discussion.

					<h3>Data Visualization for Decision Making</h3>
					<p>University of Chicago Booth School of Business 2023 - Behavioral Science Seminar Series<br />
						When visualization researchers and practitioners talk about the value of data visualization, one of the most commonly cited use cases is helping people make informed decisions.
						It is often assumed that people making decisions will benefit from mere information exposure, that if one can read data off of a chart, they will be able to use that information
						for the purpose of decision making. However, relatively little behavioral research on data visualization has applied theories and models from economics to investigate how well
						chart users can make utility-optimal decisions when relying on different displays. I present an experiment that investigates how well various forms of uncertainty visualization
						support decision making, specifically an incentivized choice about whether to pay for an intervention. In this study, I looked not only at which visualization designs best support
						decisions but also how well those same representations support chart users in estimating the effect size of the intervention versus the status quo. Through a combination of
						hypothesis testing, descriptive behavioral modeling, and qualitative analysis of users' self-reported chart interpretation strategies, I explain the effectiveness of various
						visual representations in terms of the heuristics or visual reasoning strategies that people apply when making decisions with uncertainty visualizations. I discuss how incorporating
						economic formalisms and knowledge of visual reasoning strategies into visualization research can help us build data analysis software that is better aligned with natural tendencies
						of human judgment and decision making.

					<p>SIPS 2022 - <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rka3f0ZY9BBZVIlZoVINrpyaJYeitpq1yKXBLukeMng/edit">Workshop: Multiverse Analyses - Introduction and Applications</a><br />
						Research and data science involve myiad decisions about how to collect, analyze, and report on data. These decisions impact what gets measured
						and how it gets interpreted, potentially influencing the downstream conclusions that are drawn from data. For more rigorous analysis, we need
						software tools that enable analysts to express a set of possible decisions and skeptically examine how robust their results are to different combinations
						of choices. I present Boba, a tool for multiverse analysis created in collaboration with researchers in the University of Washington <a href="http://idl.cs.washington.edu/">Interactive Data Lab</a>.
						Boba consists of both (1) a domain specific language for authoring multiverse analyses in Python, R, and other scripting languages, and (2) an interactive
						visualization tool for exploring results of multiverse analyses which runs in a web browser. In this workshop presentation, I walk through a few example analyses
						demonstrating how Boba and tools like it can improve the rigor of data analysis.

					<h3>Expect Users to Satisfice: Designing Interfaces for Reasoning with Uncertainty</h3>
					<p>SDSS 2020 - <a href="https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/sdss/2020/onlineprogram/Program.cfm?TrackID=36">User Testing Statistical Graphics</a><br />
						Conventional statistical graphics tend to emphasize point estimates and omit uncertainty information. However, given that research in
						visualization, psychology, and behavioral economics shows that people often satisfice (i.e., use heuristics that deviate from the optimal strategy)
						when reasoning with uncertainty, users of data visualizations may not recognize or correctly interpret uncertainty. I argue that we need to understand
						users' potential reasoning strategies in order to design graphical interfaces that steer users toward more systematic ways of reasoning with uncertainty.
						In this talk, I present empirical evidence on how users satisfice, both when reading individual charts and when conducting analysis, and
						I discuss ways we are designing statistical graphics and interfaces for data analysis that anticipate users' tendency to satisfice.

			<!-- <p>As a PhD student at the University of Washington Information School, I was a teaching assistant for
				two classes, Introduction to Data Science and Interactive Data Visualization. I also spent one year
				leading the UW School of Computer Science & Engineering's graduate seminar on human computer interaction.
			</p>
			<p>I helped teach Introduction to Data Science (INFO 180) with <a href="https://www.jevinwest.org/">Jevin
					West.</a> The course was an experimental flipped classroom in which students progressed through the
				course in a gamified web application created by <a
					href="https://ischool.uw.edu/people/faculty/profile/bboiko">Bob Boiko</a>. A student's objective was
				to pass a set of 7 challenges by the end of the quarter. Taking these challenges required students to
				interact with their two TAs. I held ten office hours per week, in addition to class time, providing
				one-on-one and group instruction on programming in Python and introductory topics in data science and
				statistics. In course evaluations and in person, students told me how the one-on-one instruction in
				office hours helped them to grasp concepts they were struggling with, learn from their mistakes, and
				apply the knowledge and skills we built together in future endeavors. Teaching this course was a
				transformative experience and left me with questions about how to scale and adapt this unothodox but rewarding approach to teaching.
			</p>
			<p>I also helped to teach Interactive Data Visualization (INFO 474) with <a
					href="https://students.washington.edu/yeaseul1/">Yea-Seul Kim</a>. The course consisted of a series
				of lectures, in-class activities, and projects aimed at teaching students the theoretical and empirical
				foundations of visualization design and prompting students to put this knowledge into practice. My role
				as a TA was primarily to develop and execute grading schemes that balanced learning objectives with the
				needs of our students. I also held office hours where I helped students mock-up their projects, reason
				through implementation using psuedo-code, and refine their understanding of difficult concepts from
				lectures and readings.
			</p>
			<p>I've given invited lectures on perception, color vision, and uncertainty visualization in both the UW School of Computer Science & Engineering's
				Data Visualization course (CSE 442) and the UW Information School's Interactive Data Visualization course (INFO 474).</p>
			<p>In academic year 2019-2020, I co-led the UW Computer Science and Engineering department's graduate-level Interactive
				Systems Seminar (CSE 590H) with <a href="https://jasperoleary.com/about.html">Jasper Tran O'Leary</a> under the supervision of
				<a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jfogarty/">James Fogarty</a>. Each week we read and discussed a paper relating to human computer interaction.
				Our discussions focused on design principles and requirements of different systems, empirical evaluation, and critique and synthesis of
				the literature. I organized and facilitated seminar, and frequently led discussions.</p>
			<p>Prior to graduate school I was also an undergraduate peer TA for a series of statistics courses in the UW
				Psychology Department taught by <a
					href="https://psych.uw.edu/newsletter/spring-2006/faculty/prof-laura-little-receives-uw-distinguished-teaching-award">Laura
					Little</a>.</p> -->
