				<h2>Bio</h2>
				<p>
					Hello! I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and the Data Science Institute at the 
					University of Chicago. I create and evaluate tools for helping people think with data, specializing in data 
					visualization tools for analysis and decision-making. I lead the University of Chicago's 
					<a href="dcl-website/index.html"><span class="label">Data Cognition Lab</span></a>, where we build software 
					that enables users to externalize their thinking when grappling with data-driven judgments.<br/>
				</p><br/>
				<p>
					Before starting at UChicago, I earned my PhD at the University of Washington (UW) Information School where I worked with 
					<a href="http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jhullman/"><span class="label">Jessica Hullman</span></a>. During graduate
					school, I collaborated on statistical tools with members of the <a href="https://mucollective.northwestern.edu/"><span class="label">Midwest Uncertainty Collective</span></a>
					at Northwestern University CS, the <a href="http://idl.cs.washington.edu/"><span class="label">Interactive Data Lab</span></a>
					at UW CS&E, and the <a href="https://github.com/interpretml/interpret"><span class="label">Interpret ML</span></a> 
					team at Microsoft Research. I also earned my MS in Information Science at UW in 2020 and my BS in Psychology at UW in 2015.

					I create and evaluate software to help people think with data. Visualizations and software often mediate our interactions

					to thinking with data often fail to account for the cognitive mechanisms that guide people's interpretations of data, 
					such as heuristics and other dynamic processes of the mind which underly human judgment and decision making. As a result,
					tools for reasoning with data leave us open to the failure modes of human cognition, especially around applications involving
					uncertainty and statistical reasoning. My research aims to address these problems by creating tools that explicitly represent

				<p>I create and evaluate tools to help people think with data. Tools such as visualizations, software, and AI systems typically 
					mediate our interactions with data, in part because they facilitate efficiency in thinking and communication. However, the
					efficiency and authoritativeness of these tools presents certain threats: (1) that people will accept or ignore evidence or 
					algorithmic advice at face value, rather than rigorously understanding it; (2) that data interfaces may be nominally informative
					without being sufficiently personalized to be useful for specific user groups and tasks; and (3) that data and AI systems will
					disempower human users through obfuscation and denial of agency. My research aims to address these problems by creating tools that
					account for natural cognitive pitfalls in data interpretation, by taking a participatory approach to software design, and by 
					developing new understandings of how we can make data interaction more humanistic.

						<h3>Designing for Epistemic Uncertainty in Research Synthesis</h3>
						<p>University of Wisconsin at Madison 2023 - Seminar on Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis<br />
							Summarizing what can be learned from bodies of scientific literature requires difficult judgments about which study results can be meaningfully 
							compared, and whether it makes sense to aggregate evidence in a meta-analysis. Numerous tools for assessing quality of evidence offer guidance 
							on identifying sources of epistemic uncertainty, such as common threats to internal or external validity of study results. However, existing 
							software for systematic review and meta-analysis does little to emphasize how epistemic uncertainty should inform analytic choices for synthesizing 
							findings. I present MetaExplorer, a prototype web application designed to provide a guided process for reasoning about epistemic uncertainty in 
							meta-analysis. I also summarize findings from interviews with research synthesis methodologists and practitioners in biomedical science, education, 
							computer science, and statistics. This work highlights the cognitive pitfalls, technical hurdles, and inconsistent standards across research communities 
							that pose challenges to addressing epistemic uncertainty in research synthesis. I reflect on opportunities for future software development and invite the 
							audience to join me in discussion.

						<h3>Data Visualization for Decision Making</h3>
						<p>University of Chicago Booth School of Business 2023 - Behavioral Science Seminar Series<br />
							When visualization researchers and practitioners talk about the value of data visualization, one of the most commonly cited use cases is helping people make informed decisions. 
							It is often assumed that people making decisions will benefit from mere information exposure, that if one can read data off of a chart, they will be able to use that information 
							for the purpose of decision making. However, relatively little behavioral research on data visualization has applied theories and models from economics to investigate how well 
							chart users can make utility-optimal decisions when relying on different displays. I present an experiment that investigates how well various forms of uncertainty visualization 
							support decision making, specifically an incentivized choice about whether to pay for an intervention. In this study, I looked not only at which visualization designs best support 
							decisions but also how well those same representations support chart users in estimating the effect size of the intervention versus the status quo. Through a combination of 
							hypothesis testing, descriptive behavioral modeling, and qualitative analysis of users' self-reported chart interpretation strategies, I explain the effectiveness of various 
							visual representations in terms of the heuristics or visual reasoning strategies that people apply when making decisions with uncertainty visualizations. I discuss how incorporating 
							economic formalisms and knowledge of visual reasoning strategies into visualization research can help us build data analysis software that is better aligned with natural tendencies 
							of human judgment and decision making.

						<h3>Using Boba to Author and Visualize Multiverse Analyses</h3>
						<p>SIPS 2022 - <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rka3f0ZY9BBZVIlZoVINrpyaJYeitpq1yKXBLukeMng/edit">Workshop: Multiverse Analyses - Introduction and Applications</a><br />
							Research and data science involve myiad decisions about how to collect, analyze, and report on data. These decisions impact what gets measured 
							and how it gets interpreted, potentially influencing the downstream conclusions that are drawn from data. For more rigorous analysis, we need
							software tools that enable analysts to express a set of possible decisions and skeptically examine how robust their results are to different combinations
							of choices. I present Boba, a tool for multiverse analysis created in collaboration with researchers in the University of Washington <a href="http://idl.cs.washington.edu/"><span class="label">Interactive Data Lab</span></a>.
							Boba consists of both (1) a domain specific language for authoring multiverse analyses in Python, R, and other scripting languages, and (2) an interactive
							visualization tool for exploring results of multiverse analyses which runs in a web browser. In this workshop presentation, I walk through a few example analyses
							demonstrating how Boba and tools like it can improve the rigor of data analysis.

						<h3>Expect Users to Satisfice: Designing Interfaces for Reasoning with Uncertainty</h3>
						<p>SDSS 2020 - <a href="https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/sdss/2020/onlineprogram/Program.cfm?TrackID=36">User Testing Statistical Graphics</a><br />
							Conventional statistical graphics tend to emphasize point estimates and omit uncertainty information. However, given that research in 
							visualization, psychology, and behavioral economics shows that people often satisfice (i.e., use heuristics that deviate from the optimal strategy) 
							when reasoning with uncertainty, users of data visualizations may not recognize or correctly interpret uncertainty. I argue that we need to understand 
							users' potential reasoning strategies in order to design graphical interfaces that steer users toward more systematic ways of reasoning with uncertainty. 
							In this talk, I present empirical evidence on how users satisfice, both when reading individual charts and when conducting analysis, and 
							I discuss ways we are designing statistical graphics and interfaces for data analysis that anticipate users' tendency to satisfice.

			<!-- <p>As a PhD student at the University of Washington Information School, I was a teaching assistant for 
				two classes, Introduction to Data Science and Interactive Data Visualization. I also spent one year 
				leading the UW School of Computer Science & Engineering's graduate seminar on human computer interaction.
			</p>
			<p>I helped teach Introduction to Data Science (INFO 180) with <a href="https://www.jevinwest.org/">Jevin
					West.</a> The course was an experimental flipped classroom in which students progressed through the
				course in a gamified web application created by <a
					href="https://ischool.uw.edu/people/faculty/profile/bboiko">Bob Boiko</a>. A student's objective was
				to pass a set of 7 challenges by the end of the quarter. Taking these challenges required students to
				interact with their two TAs. I held ten office hours per week, in addition to class time, providing
				one-on-one and group instruction on programming in Python and introductory topics in data science and
				statistics. In course evaluations and in person, students told me how the one-on-one instruction in
				office hours helped them to grasp concepts they were struggling with, learn from their mistakes, and
				apply the knowledge and skills we built together in future endeavors. Teaching this course was a
				transformative experience and left me with questions about how to scale and adapt this unothodox but rewarding approach to teaching.
			</p>
			<p>I also helped to teach Interactive Data Visualization (INFO 474) with <a
					href="https://students.washington.edu/yeaseul1/">Yea-Seul Kim</a>. The course consisted of a series
				of lectures, in-class activities, and projects aimed at teaching students the theoretical and empirical
				foundations of visualization design and prompting students to put this knowledge into practice. My role
				as a TA was primarily to develop and execute grading schemes that balanced learning objectives with the
				needs of our students. I also held office hours where I helped students mock-up their projects, reason
				through implementation using psuedo-code, and refine their understanding of difficult concepts from
				lectures and readings.
			</p>
			<p>I've given invited lectures on perception, color vision, and uncertainty visualization in both the UW School of Computer Science & Engineering's 
				Data Visualization course (CSE 442) and the UW Information School's Interactive Data Visualization course (INFO 474).</p>
			<p>In academic year 2019-2020, I co-led the UW Computer Science and Engineering department's graduate-level Interactive
				Systems Seminar (CSE 590H) with <a href="https://jasperoleary.com/about.html">Jasper Tran O'Leary</a> under the supervision of 
				<a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jfogarty/">James Fogarty</a>. Each week we read and discussed a paper relating to human computer interaction. 
				Our discussions focused on design principles and requirements of different systems, empirical evaluation, and critique and synthesis of
				the literature. I organized and facilitated seminar, and frequently led discussions.</p>
			<p>Prior to graduate school I was also an undergraduate peer TA for a series of statistics courses in the UW
				Psychology Department taught by <a
					href="https://psych.uw.edu/newsletter/spring-2006/faculty/prof-laura-little-receives-uw-distinguished-teaching-award">Laura
					Little</a>.</p> -->
