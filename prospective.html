					<p class="last">
						This page is meant to provide information for prospective students and postdocs about what we look for
						in lab members, lab culture, mentorship model, and other frequently asked questions. <b>In the 2024 cycle, 
							we are recruiting one PhD student and one postdoc. We are not recruiting undergraduate and masters 
							students at this time.</b>

			<article id="mentorship" class="wrapper style2">
				<div class="container">
					<h2>Mentorship Model</h2>
					<p>
						We believe in providing lab members with the highest possible quality of mentorship
						and training. To us, this means a combination of relationship building, one-on-one attention,
						frequent critical feedback, and fast-paced project-based learning that provides scaffolding 
						while aiming to maximize a mentee's sense of ownership and agency over the work. This is intended
						to prepare mentees to be independent researchers in competative career paths (e.g., professorships,
						industry research).
					</p>
					<p>
						This approach requires a <i>highly reciprocal relationship</i> between mentor and mentee, which means that both 
						mentor and mentee enter the research advising relationship with strong expectations and a sense of 
						interpersonal responsibility. The considerations below outline the contract between advisor and PhD student,
						but similar expectations apply for non-PhD research assistants and postdocs joining the group.
					</p>
					<section class="box style1">
						<h4>PhD Student Responsibilities</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Publish at top visualization and human-computer interaction venues every 6-18 months. Keeping pace 
								is important for your professional development. Long stymied periods will hurt your future job prospects.
							</li>
							<li>
								Spend working hours to advance shared research projects with your advisor or otherwise pursuing approved
								professional development (e.g., collaborations, doctoral colloquia).
							</li>
							<li>
								Work as a teaching assistant when requested to. This duty is part of the funding model for PhD programs,
								and it serves both as a professional development opportunity and a contribution to the University's 
								educational mission.
							</li>
							<li>
								Volunteer to peer review after year 2 of the PhD program. A good rule is to review 2 papers for each
								paper you submit as a first author.
							</li>
							<li>
								Volunteer to organize and participate in academic events with fellow students in the department and beyond.
								This kind of peer support dramatically improves the research experience for everyone involved, and it's a
								huge part of what makes a research group have a vibrant culture.
							</li>
							<li>
								Communicate needs and roadblocks to advisor in a timely fashion. Lack of communication should never be the
								bottleneck for your research progress.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section class="box style1">
						<h4>Advisor Responsibilities</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Apply for grants to support student-led projects of mutual interest. This entails a committment to 
								seek out funding sources that align with a mentee's research interests, so paid research assistantships
								are as relevant as possible to the student's thesis.
							</li>
							<li>
								Fund 2 quarters of research assistantship per year, plus summers as needed.
							</li>
							<li>
								Send students to 1+ academic conference(s) per year based on shared research interests. After year 1 of 
								the PhD program, students will be expected to present at any conference they attend.
							</li>
							<li>
								Host weekly or biweekly one-on-one advising meetings to discuss projects and professional development.
							</li>
							<li>
								Host weekly or biweekly lab meetings for team-building and skill sharing.
							</li>
							<li>
								Send prompt feedback on writing, presentations, and other research materials in progress.
							</li>
							<li>
								Help students network. This means I will do my best to introduce you to people who can help you advance
								your career goals, whether these are possible collaborators, possible future mentors, or potential employers.
							</li>
							<li>
								Manage the lab. This means making governance decisions: Who is in or out of the lab? How are funds spent? 
								What projects and sources of funding to we pursue?
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section class="box style1">
						<h4>Shared Responsibilities</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Cultivate lab culture. This means maintaining rapport with other lab members, attending events, and going
								to campus on a regular basis. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Skill sharing and collaboration. Generally, we lift each other up when our lab mates need help. Students are 
								encouraged to collaborate on projects of mutual interest, as long as there is a clear division of labor and 
								an undisputed project leader.
							</li>
							<li>
								Protect your time. As academics, we often are asked to do things that are not in our best interest and which do
								not advance our research agenda. Resist these distractions when possible, and when in doubt, let's have a conversation about it.
							</li>
							<li>
								Maintain a safe and inclusive work environment. We will practice mutual respect and open-mindedness. Discrimination, harrassment, 
								or violence of any form will not be tolerated. Any concerns should be reported to Alex or to another relevant authority figure.
							<li>
								Set ambitious professional goals. Membership in the lab is predicated on doing the highest possible quality
								research and striving for excellence in career outcomes. This is something we sustain together.
							</li>

				<div class="container">
					<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
					<p>
						The following are questions that we receive frequently from prospective students, in no
						particular order. Our answers to these questions will help you prepare a successful application
						to research programs at UChicago and will help you decide if the Data Cognition Lab is a good fit.
					</p>
					<section class="box style1">
						<h4>What should I include in a written research statement?</h4>
						<p>
							Successful PhD and postdoc applications typically submit three strong letters of recommendation 
							along with an excellently-written statement telling a story about how their research experiences 
							and interests align with one or two potential advisors. Research statements should propose possible
							research project the applicant would be interested in working on. These are meant to demonstrate how
							you think about research and how your interests align concretely with the potential advisor(s) you
							identify.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section class="box style1">
						<h4>What is the lab currently working on?</h4>
						<p>
							We are currently focused on creating visualizations and statistical tools to support data exploration
							and data sharing, appraisal of the intrumental value of datasets, model interpretability, knowledge 
							mobilization for decision-making, and participatory decision-making in the realm of public policy. 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section class="box style1">
						<h4>What academic background do I need to join the lab?</h4>
						<p>
							We invite scholars from a variety of academic backgrounds since the nature of our work is highly
							interdisciplinary. Backgrounds in the behavioral sciences are highly relevant because we design
							experiments and build cognitive models of human behavior. Backgrounds in computer science and software
							engineering are highly relevant because we build toolkits, prototypes, and systems to make ideas
							usable, test hypotheses, and demonstrate proof-of-concept. Backgrounds in human-computer
							interaction and user experience research are highly relevant because we tend to address questions
							about people's technology use, and we need to run interview-based user studies.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section class="box style1">
						<h4>What does Alex look for in prospective PhD students?</h4>
						<p class="last">
							The two primary things that I look for in prospective advisees are research fit and intrinsic motivation.
							Research fit involves your taste in projects, the questions you ask, and way you think about research
							more broadly. Some of this has to do with familiarity with and interest in my research area; we need to be
							able to agree on projects to pursue. Some of it has to do with skills; we need to be able to execute the 
							work we might want to do. Mostly this has to do with creative energy; we need to be excited about meeting
							to talk about research for 5+ years, and those conversations need to generate new ideas.
						</p>
						<p class="last">
							Intrinsic motivation (and time) is most of what it takes to do a PhD. Research is often difficult. There
							will be periods of doubt, tribulation, and failure when you need grit and stubborn goal-orientedness to 
							push through. This career can be rewarding in an almost spiritual sort of way, like any situation in which 
							you overcome a great obstacle or triumph in the face of adversity. However, this outcome is far from guaranteed.
							I want to see that you have what it takes, that you know how to commit to something hard and do the work.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section class="box style1">
						<h4>What does Alex look for in prospective postdocs?</h4>
						<p>
							In prospective postdocs, I seek partners who will lead a mix of independent and supervised research in the lab 
							on topics of mutual interest. Ideally, postdocs will pursue research that advances both my research agenda and
							their own simultaniously. This role requires someone who has experience producing top-tier research in 
							visualization and human-computer interaction. Beyond this base qualification, research fit is highly important
							(see above under "What does Alex look for in prospective PhD students?"). Postdocs should also have a strong 
							interest in mentoring students and generally learning the skills involved in managing a research group. Ideally, 
							postdocs will prepare for competative careers in research (e.g., professorships, industry research).
						</p>
					</section>
					<section class="box style1">
						<h4>How can undergraduate and master's students get involved in the lab?</h4>
						<p>
							We usually recruit people when there is a strong match in research interests and/or when an ongoing project in the 
							lab needs more people working on it. We will post a link to project descriptions at the <a href="#top">top</a> of 
							this page when we are looking for someone. Typically, undergraduate or masters students will be paired with a PhD 
							student or postdoc to help supervise their work. In cases where an undergraduate or masters student has demonstrated
							exceptional ability and committment to research, the lab is open to hosting student-led research projects.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section class="box style1">
						<h4>How does Alex handle emails and meeting requests from prospective students?</h4>
						<p>
							Alex receives hundreds of emails from prospective students each fall. Although he makes an honest
							effort to look at and consider each email, there simply is not enough time to reply to all of them.
							In the interest of fairness, Alex uses a triage process to select a small subset of emails to reply 
							to, which entails a judgment of whether a prospective student (1) seems like a reasonable fit for the lab
							in terms of their skills and research interests and (2) seems likely to be competative for the position they
							are applying for. Although it's possible that Alex missed an initial email, non-responses should generally
							be read as a signal rather than a lack of signal.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section class="box style1">
						<h4>Where do I apply for positions in the lab?</h4>
						<p class="last">
							We are currently recruiting PhD students through UChicago's PhD programs in <a href="https://codas.uchicago.edu/academics/phd-in-data-science/">Data Science</a>
