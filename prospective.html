						This page is meant to provide information for prospective students and postdocs about what we look for
						in lab members and other frequently asked questions. <b>In the 2024 cycle, we are recruiting one PhD 
						student and one postdoc. We are not recruiting undergraduate and masters students at this time.</b>

					<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
					<p>
						The following are questions that we receive frequently from prospective students, in no
						particular order. Our answers to these questions will help you prepare a successful application
						to research programs at UChicago and will help you decide if the Data Cognition Lab is a good fit.
					</p>
					<section class="box style1">
						<h4>What should I include in a written research statement?</h4>
						<p>
							Successful PhD and postdoc applications typically submit three strong letters of recommendation 
							along with an excellently-written statement telling a story about how their research experiences 
							and interests align with one or two potential advisors. Research statements should propose possible
							research project the applicant would be interested in working on. These are meant to demonstrate how
							you think about research and how your interests align concretely with the potential advisor(s) you
							identify.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section class="box style1">
						<h4>What is the lab currently working on?</h4>
						<p>
							We are currently focused on creating visualizations and statistical tools to support data exploration
							and data sharing, appraisal of the intrumental value of datasets, model interpretability, knowledge 
							mobilization for decision-making, and participatory decision-making in the realm of public policy. 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section class="box style1">
						<h4>What academic background do I need to join the lab?</h4>
						<p>
							We invite scholars from a variety of academic backgrounds since the nature of our work is highly
							interdisciplinary. Backgrounds in the behavioral sciences are highly relevant because we design
							experiments and build cognitive models of human behavior. Backgrounds in computer science and software
							engineering are highly relevant because we build toolkits, prototypes, and systems to make ideas
							usable, test hypotheses, and demonstrate proof-of-concept. Backgrounds in human-computer
							interaction and user experience research are highly relevant because we tend to address questions
							about people's technology use, and we need to run interview-based user studies.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section class="box style1">
						<h4>What does Alex look for in prospective PhD students?</h4>
						<p class="last">
							The two primary things that I look for in prospective advisees are research fit and intrinsic motivation.
							Research fit involves your taste in projects, the questions you ask, and way you think about research
							more broadly. Some of this has to do with familiarity with and interest in my research area; we need to be
							able to agree on projects to pursue. Some of it has to do with skills; we need to be able to execute the 
							work we might want to do. Mostly this has to do with creative energy; we need to be excited about meeting
							to talk about research for 5+ years, and those conversations need to generate new ideas.
						</p>
						<p class="last">
							Intrinsic motivation (and time) is most of what it takes to do a PhD. Research can be difficult. There will 
							be unexpected obstacles and periods of doubt when you need grit and a certain level of commitment to push 
							through. I look for intrinsic motivation because I want students taking this journey with the lab to succeed.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section class="box style1">
						<h4>What does Alex look for in prospective postdocs?</h4>
						<p>
							In prospective postdocs, I seek partners who will lead a mix of independent and supervised research in the lab 
							on topics of mutual interest. Ideally, postdocs will pursue research that advances both my research agenda and
							their own simultaniously. This role requires someone who has experience producing top-tier research in 
							visualization and human-computer interaction. Beyond this base qualification, research fit is highly important
							(see above under "What does Alex look for in prospective PhD students?"). Postdocs should also have a strong 
							interest in mentoring students and generally learning the skills involved in managing a research group.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section class="box style1">
						<h4>How can undergraduate and master's students get involved in the lab?</h4>
						<p>
							We usually recruit people when there is a strong match in research interests and/or when an ongoing project in the 
							lab needs more people working on it. We will post a link to project descriptions at the <a href="#top">top</a> of 
							this page when we are looking for someone. Typically, undergraduate or masters students will be paired with a PhD 
							student or postdoc to help supervise their work. In cases where an undergraduate or masters student has demonstrated
							exceptional ability and committment to research, the lab is open to hosting student-led research projects.
						</p>
					</section>
					<!-- <section class="box style1">
						<h4>How does Alex handle emails and meeting requests from prospective students?</h4>
						<p>
							Alex receives hundreds of emails from prospective students each fall. Although he makes an honest
							effort to look at and consider each email, there simply is not enough time to reply to all of them.
							In the interest of fairness, Alex uses a triage process to select a small subset of emails to reply 
							to, which entails a judgment of whether a prospective student (1) seems like a reasonable fit for the lab
							in terms of their skills and research interests and (2) seems likely to be competative for the position they
							are applying for. Although it's possible that Alex missed an initial email, non-responses should generally
							be read as a signal rather than a lack of signal.

						<h4>Where do I apply for positions in the lab?</h4>
						<p class="last">
							We are currently recruiting PhD students through UChicago's PhD programs in <a href="https://codas.uchicago.edu/academics/phd-in-data-science/">Data Science</a>
							and <a href="https://cs.uchicago.edu/academics/phd/phd-program-overview/">Computer Science</a>.
						</p>
						<p class="last">
							Current opportunities for postdoc positions are through the Data Science Institute's 
							<a href="https://datascience.uchicago.edu/research/postdoctoral-programs/dsi-scholars/">postdoc scholars program</a>.
						</p>
						<p class="last">
							We recruit undergraduate and masters students on a per project basis. The best ways to find out about these positions
							are to email Alex and to keep an eye on this page.
