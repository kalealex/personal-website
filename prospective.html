						<h4>Knowledge Mobilization for Decision-Making in Education</h4>
						<p>
							This interdisciplinary collaboration aims to reinvent science communication for evidence-based
							decision-making in education. Currently, the US Department of Education hosts websites like
							<a href="https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/">What Works Clearinghouse</a> to summarize scientific 
							evidence on educational interventions and their outcomes, with the goal that teachers, principles,
							superintendents, etc. can make more efficacious choices in their classrooms, schools, and disticts.
							Together with statistics Profs. <a href="https://www.bethtipton.com/">Beth Tipton</a> and <a href="https://katie-fitzgerald.netlify.app/">Kaitlyn Fitzgerald</a>, 
							we proposed to redesign the summaries of scientific evidence on these platforms using empirical software
							testing and user-centered design practices.
						</p>
						<p>
							This project entails solving problems around visualizing statistical results from scientific research, 
							summarizing and modeling studies that vary in their research designs, helping non-statisticians
							reason about sources of uncertainty in data, and designing software for to help scientists create 
							actionable decision-aids based on education research. This touches on important and timely topics such
							as causal inference, fairness, and algorithmic assistance for human judgment and decision-making.

							This project is ideal for a postdoc with a strong interest in statistics and human-centered software
							development. We envision recruiting someone from either background to help us co-design tools with
							education researchers and decision-makers. Join us to create a new standard for communicating about
							meta-analysis and evidence aggregation!

						<h4>Participatory Budgeting in Chicago</h4>
						<p>
							This project is an effort to use visualization research for social good in Chicago. The City currently
							uses a process called <a href="https://www.participatepbchicago.org/">participatory budgeting</a> to 
							include residents in decision-making about how local funding is spent within each Ward. We are interested
							in using visualization to help facilitate this process, e.g., through more expressive interfaces for residents
							to express their preferences, or through outreach activities that use visualization to promote transparancy and 
							perspective-taking around collective decisions.
						</p>
						<p>
							This project cuts across problems in visualization, digital civics, voting methods, and preference elicitation. 
							It synthesizes ideas and methods from HCI, economics, political science, and urban planning. Read about our
							initial foray into this topic in our recent paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20103">What Can Interactive 
							Visualization do for Participatory Budgeting in Chicago?</a>

					<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
					<p>
						The following are questions that we receive frequently from prospective students. Our answers to 
						these questions will help you prepare a successful application to research programs at UChicago 
						and will help you decide if the Data Cognition Lab is a good fit.
					</p>
					<section class="box style1">
						<h4>What should I include in a written research statement?</h4>
						<p>
							Successful PhD and postdoc applications typically submit three strong letters of recommendation 
							along with an excellently-written statement telling a story about how their research experiences 
							and interests align with one or two potential advisors. Research statements should propose possible
							research project(s) the applicant would be interested in working on. These are meant to demonstrate how
							you think about research and how your interests align concretely with the potential advisor(s) you
							identify.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section class="box style1">
						<h4>What is the lab currently working on?</h4>
						<p>
							We are currently focused on creating visualizations and statistical tools to support data exploration
							and data sharing, appraisal of the intrumental value of datasets, strategic and personalized design of 
							visualizations, model interpretability, and decision-making.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section class="box style1">
						<h4>What academic background do I need to join the lab?</h4>
						<p>
							We invite scholars from a variety of academic backgrounds since the nature of our work is highly
							interdisciplinary. Backgrounds in the behavioral sciences are highly relevant because we design
							experiments and build cognitive models of human behavior. Backgrounds in computer science and software
							engineering are highly relevant because we build toolkits, prototypes, and systems to make ideas
							usable, test hypotheses, and demonstrate proof-of-concept. Backgrounds in statistics and research
							methodology are highly relevant becasue many of our projects involve aspects of modeling, uncertainty,
							and epistemology in creating new ways to work with data. Backgrounds in human-computer interaction and 
							user experience research are highly relevant because we tend to address questions about people's 
							technology use, and we need to run interview-based user studies.
						</p>
					</section>

						<h4>What does Alex look for in prospective PhD students?</h4>
						<p>
							The two primary things that I look for in prospective advisees are research fit and intrinsic motivation.
							Research fit involves your taste in projects, the questions you ask, and way you think about research
							more broadly. Some of this has to do with familiarity with and interest in my research area; we need to be
							able to agree on projects to pursue. Some of it has to do with skills; we need to be able to execute the 
							work we might want to do. Mostly this has to do with creative energy; we need to be excited about meeting
							to talk about research for 5+ years, and those conversations need to generate new ideas.
						</p>
						<p class="last">
							Intrinsic motivation (and time) is most of what it takes to do a PhD. Research can be difficult. There will 
							be unexpected obstacles and periods of doubt when you need grit and a certain level of commitment to push 
							through. I look for intrinsic motivation because I want students taking this journey with the lab to succeed.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section class="box style1">
						<h4>What does Alex look for in prospective postdocs?</h4>
						<p>
							In prospective postdocs, I seek partners who will lead a mix of independent and supervised research in the lab 
							on topics of mutual interest. Postdocs in the DCL should pursue research that advances both my research agenda 
							and their own simultaniously. This could look a lot of different ways and could entail publishing in a variety of 
							venues or disciplines. However, prospective postdocs should know that I am most equipped to help you publish
							top-tier research in visualization and human-computer interaction, and have a professional imperative to submit
							work to computer science conferences, which will shape your experience working with me. Postdocs should have 
							a strong interest in mentoring students and generally learning the skills involved in managing a research group.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section class="box style1">
						<h4>How can undergraduate and master's students get involved in the lab?</h4>
						<p>
							We usually recruit people when there is a strong match in research interests and/or when an ongoing project in the 
							lab needs more people working on it. We will post descriptions of active projects we are recruiting for <a href="#projects">above</a>. 
							Typically, undergraduate or masters students will be paired with a PhD student or postdoc to help supervise their work. 
							In cases where an undergraduate or masters student has demonstrated exceptional ability and committment to research, 
							the lab is open to hosting student-led research projects.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section class="box style1">
						<h4>Where do I apply for positions in the lab?</h4>
						<p class="last">
							We are currently recruiting PhD students through UChicago's PhD programs in <a href="https://codas.uchicago.edu/academics/phd-in-data-science/">Data Science</a>
							and <a href="https://cs.uchicago.edu/academics/phd/phd-program-overview/">Computer Science</a>.
