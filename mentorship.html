					<h2>Mentorship Model</h2>
					<p>
						We believe in providing lab members with the highest possible quality of mentorship
						and training. To us, this means a combination of relationship building, one-on-one attention,
						frequent critical feedback, and fast-paced project-based learning that provides scaffolding 
						while aiming to maximize a mentee's sense of ownership and agency over the work. This is intended
						to prepare mentees to be independent researchers in competative career paths (e.g., professorships,
						industry research).
					</p>
					<p>
						This approach requires a <i>highly reciprocal relationship</i> between mentor and mentee, which means that both 
						mentor and mentee enter the research advising relationship with strong expectations and a sense of 
						interpersonal responsibility. The considerations below outline a rough contract between advisor and PhD student,
						which is intended less as a rigid set of guarantees and more as a reflection on the responsibilties involved
						in lab membership. After all, every adivising relationship is different and mentorship research requires more 
						flexibility than can be written into a hard set of rules. Nonetheless, we believe it is helpful to communicate
						clearly about expectations. Although the following is written with PhD advising in mind, similar expectations 
						apply for non-PhD research assistants and postdocs joining the group.
					</p>

						<h4>PhD Student Responsibilities</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Publish at top visualization and human-computer interaction venues every 6-18 months. Keeping pace 
								is important for your professional development. Long stymied periods will hurt your future job prospects.
							</li>
							<li>
								Spend working hours to advance shared research projects with your advisor or otherwise pursuing approved
								professional development (e.g., collaborations, doctoral colloquia).
							</li>
							<li>
								Work as a teaching assistant when requested to. This duty is part of the funding model for PhD programs,
								and it serves both as a professional development opportunity and a contribution to the University's 
								educational mission.
							</li>
							<li>
								Volunteer to peer review after year 2 of the PhD program. A good rule is to review 2 papers for each
								paper you submit as a first author.
							</li>
							<li>
								Volunteer to organize and participate in academic events with fellow students in the department and beyond.
								This kind of peer support dramatically improves the research experience for everyone involved, and it's a
								huge part of what makes a research group have a vibrant culture.
							</li>
							<li>
								Communicate needs and roadblocks to advisor in a timely fashion. Lack of communication should never be the
								bottleneck for your research progress.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section class="box style1">
						<h4>Advisor Responsibilities</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Apply for grants to support student-led projects of mutual interest. This entails a committment to 
								seek out funding sources that align with a mentee's research interests, so paid research assistantships
								are as relevant as possible to the student's thesis.
							</li>
							<li>
								Fund research assistantships (probably ~2 quarters each year depending on research progress and availability 
								of funds), plus summers as needed.
							</li>
							<li>
								Send students to 1+ academic conference(s) per year based on shared research interests. After year 1 of 
								the PhD program, students will be expected to present at any conference they attend.
							</li>
							<li>
								Host weekly or biweekly one-on-one advising meetings to discuss projects and professional development.
							</li>
							<li>
								Host weekly or biweekly lab meetings for team-building and skill sharing.
							</li>
							<li>
								Send prompt feedback on writing, presentations, and other research materials in progress.
							</li>
							<li>
								Help students network. This means I will do my best to introduce you to people who can help you advance
								your career goals, whether these are possible collaborators, possible future mentors, or potential employers.
							</li>
							<li>
								Manage the lab. This means making governance decisions: Who is in or out of the lab? How are funds spent? 
								What projects and sources of funding to we pursue?
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section class="box style1">
						<h4>Shared Responsibilities</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Cultivate lab culture. This means maintaining rapport with other lab members, attending events, and going
								to campus on a regular basis. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Skill sharing and collaboration. Generally, we lift each other up when our lab mates need help. Students are 
								encouraged to collaborate on projects of mutual interest, as long as there is a clear division of labor and 
								an undisputed project leader.
							</li>
							<li>
								Protect your time. As academics, we often are asked to do things that are not in our best interest and which do
								not advance our research agenda. Resist these distractions when possible, and when in doubt, let's have a conversation about it.
							</li>
							<li>
								Maintain a safe and inclusive work environment. We will practice mutual respect and open-mindedness. Discrimination, harrassment, 
								or violence of any form will not be tolerated. Any concerns should be reported to Alex or to another relevant authority figure.
							<li>
								Set ambitious professional goals. Membership in the lab is predicated on doing the highest possible quality
								research and striving for excellence in career outcomes. This is something we sustain together.
							</li>
